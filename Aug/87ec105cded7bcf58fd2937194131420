Lagos – Lari Williams, a notable actor and playwright, on Monday urged the Federal Government to beam its searchlight on the entertainment industry.
Williams told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Lagos that there was a need to find out how funds given by the past administration for the development of the industry were utilised.
‘‘There was cash grant for the development of arts in Nigeria which was given to the sector by the immediate past president, but we practitioners did not know how these grants were disbursed.
‘‘We need to know how the funds given to the sector are being allocated because the growth of Nigeria’s entertainment industry will be enhanced by such funds, if well utilised,’’ he said.
Williams also said that the entertainment industry needed people who were knowledgeable in arts at the helm of affairs, to ensure better administration.
‘‘Let’s restructure the industry to give it a better foundation for entertainment sector to grow.
‘‘I always say `No bird can fly high on bald winds’, we are just focused on just one aspect of entertainment which is not helping the industry.
‘‘We should not develop only the screen and leave behind theatre and stage plays, ‘‘he said.
According to him, proper management of the resources from the sector will help to keep artists employed. [pro_ad_display_adzone id=”10″]
“The decline in the creativity of sculptors, painters, poets, writers and musicians can be attributed to lack of facilities on ground to harness these talents.
‘‘If fund given by the former president was made available in grooming talents, the arts and culture sector would have been enhanced,’’ he said.(NAN)
