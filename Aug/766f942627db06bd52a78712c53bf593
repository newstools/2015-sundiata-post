Lagos – A 30-year-old commercial driver, Kunle Lawal, who allegedly stole a bus valued at N1.1million belonging to one Oladimeji Olaniyi, was on Wednesday docked at the Ikeja Magistrates’ Court, Lagos. Lawal, a resident of Apapa area of Lagos, is facing a two-count charge of conspiracy and stealing. The accused, however, pleaded not guilty to the charges against him. Earlier, the Prosecutor, Sgt. Joseph Ajebe, had told the court that the accused committed the offences on July 10, at No. 25, Ibido St., Orile, Lagos. Ajebe told the court that the accused conspired with others now at large to steal Olaniyi’s bus. The prosecutor said: “The complainant gave the bus to Lawal for commercial purpose and for him to be remitting a certain amount daily. “Instead, the accused conspired with others to lie that the vehicle had been stolen by an unknown person.“ Ajebe said that the offences contravened the Sections 285 and 409 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2011. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Section 285 prescribes three years’ imprisonment for stealing, while Section 409 says that any person culpable of conspiracy will remain in prison for two years.
