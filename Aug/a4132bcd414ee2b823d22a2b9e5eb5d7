Ado-Ekiti – The National Directorate of Employment (NDE) said it would partner the Nigeria Prisons Service to train inmates at the Ado-Ekiti prisons.
Director of the Agency in the state, Mr Babatope Akinyemi, disclosed this in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Ado-Ekiti on Tuesday.
[pro_ad_display_adzone id=”10″] Akinyemi decried the situation where discharged inmates from the prisons return to the streets, homeless and begging.
He said that some of the former inmates were stigmatized either by the society or even their own families, adding that this could lead them to commit greater offences and return to prison.
He said that some of them resort to street urchins, armed robbers, thugs, drug pushers and prostitutes.
The NDE boss pointed out that the rate of crime and insecurity in the country had soared and attributed the situation to high level of unemployment.
He called on the government, Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) and stakeholders to help skilled youths with soft loans to alleviate their sufferings and make them better citizen.
He disclosed that training at the prison would be on soap making, baking, olive oil making, weaving, computer and tailoring. (NAN)
