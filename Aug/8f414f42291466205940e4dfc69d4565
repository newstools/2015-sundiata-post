Madrid – Scientists and researchers and doctors at Carlos III Hospital in Madrid have said they are on the verge of commencing clinical trials on an Ebola vaccine which could be available for use within a year.
Speaking on behalf of the team, Dr Martha Arsuaga, from Carlos III Hospital, said on Wednesday the vaccine was jointly developed by WHO and Doctors Without Borders with the collaboration of some nations such as Spain.
She said it has been successfully tested on animals similar to humans and 4,000 volunteers in Guinea.
Arsuaga said the vaccines would now be tested on a series of Spanish volunteers.
She said none of the volunteers would receive any payment for their efforts, other than the satisfaction of knowing their efforts could help to save thousands of lives in the future.
She said the vaccine was produced by introducing an Ebola protein in another virus.
Arsuaga said through such process types of antibodies that are produced and how long after the introduction of the vaccine they are produced and what immunity they give could be determined.
She said this is the third stage in the vaccine development which has taken place over the last 12 months.
“Now in less than a year we have developed a vaccine, which is very good and with very few side effects and which is efficient. It has been a challenge and an achievement”, she said.
Arsuaga said that it took a long a time to get to this stage of trial because Ebola was a complicated virus because of its special characteristics.

“It’s hard to make a vaccine because there are several types of Ebola and it is hard to make one which covers them all”, she said. (Xinhua/NAN)
