Port Harcourt, –  A former member of the House of Representatives, Mr Andrew Uchendu, has urged Nigerians to support President Muhammadu Buhari in his bid to tackle the challenges facing the country. Uchendu (APC-Ikwerre/Emohua Constituency) in the 7th Assembly, told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Port Harcourt that the challenges facing the country require proper evaluation to effect the needed change. The former lawmaker, who argued that it would be unfair for Nigerians to judge Buhari so soon, said: “ Some Nigerians, who are expecting so much from the president, within the shortest time are unfair to him. “ We should remember that this is a democratic system and not the military era when the country was ruled by decrees and edicts. “ As an experienced manager of both men and materials, I can attest to the fact that Buhari has done very well in 30 days.’’ According to Uchendu, Buhari’s style and administrative approach to issues are commendable. “The environment Nigeria found itself as at the period President Buhari took over power was most unfriendly both internally and externally.[pro_ad_display_adzone id=”70560”] “He focused on creating a little bit of conducive environment by trying to reassure Nigerians that all hopes were not lost concerning security of lives and properties,’’ he said. Uchendu said Buhari visited Niger, Chad and Cameroon to ensure that there was a coalition of countries to combat the Boko Haram sect. He said the move by Buhari had reassured Nigerians that the government was serious in fighting insurgency. (NAN)
