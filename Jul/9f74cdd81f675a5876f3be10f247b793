Alhaji Sada Haidara, the Education Secretary for the area, told the News Agency of Nigeria ( NAN) on Wednesday in Sokoto that the affected officers were suspended for one month and would forfeit their salaries for the period. “I took the action on July 14 sequel to repeated unscheduled inspection visits to the school. In all the visits, I did not meet the headmaster, teachers or any pupil. “There was nobody in the school, it was a security guard of a neigbhouring state government water project who informed me that lessons had not been going on in the school.[pro_ad_display_adzone id=”70560″] “The head master is always putting his telephone off, while the AEO was also suspended as he had failed in his duty to monitor the school,” Haidara said.
