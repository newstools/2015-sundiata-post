ABUJA (Sundiata Post) – The Presidency has denied having any link with a Twitter account said to belong to Zahra Buhari, one of the daughters of President Muhammadu Buhari.
In a statement made available to Sundiata Post on Sunday, Mallam Garba Shehu, Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, the Presidency said it’s attention “has been drawn to unauthorised and unexpected Tweets by an account falsely linked to Zahra Buhari, one of the daughters of President Muhammadu Buhari.
 “Following enquiries by a few foreign missions on the raging online controversy about unsavoury comments against some foreign leaders purportedly made by her, we wish to state categorically that Zahra is indeed on Twitter but the offending handle @Zahra_Buhari has stopped being her own for a long time since it was compromised by hackers.
 “Tweets by this handle are therefore not her own and should be disregarded and considered as the work of hackers seeking to cause mischief between this country and other friendly states.
 “Zahra’s authentic handle is @ZmBuhari and any handle other than this on Twitter should be considered as fake and therefore fraudulent.
 “It is also pertinent to state at this point that neither the wife of the President, Mrs. Aisha Buhari nor the other children are presently on Twitter, Facebook or the various other platforms.
 “As they explore the possibilities on this new territory, we request the general public to ignore the many accounts on various platforms in their names that currently exist. Such accounts, beside the authentic one cited above in the name of Zahra are unauthorised and therefore fake. 
There has been concern in diplomatic circles over offensive tweets from the account said to belong to the president’s daughter.
