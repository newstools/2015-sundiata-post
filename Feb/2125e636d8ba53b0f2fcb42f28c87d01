The National President of the association, Mrs Ifeyinwa Omowole, gave the commendation in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Abuja.
Omowole said that the development would open up the space for increased participation of women in politics.
“We have some women, who can handle certain positions but because they have to go through the rigours of party wrangling and some men, who may not want them to get there.
“So for me, this independent candidature is a welcome development for women in politics,’’ she said.
She added that women, who were schemed out in the past because of party politics, could now have their way to contest for elective positions.
NAN recalls that the National Assembly on Wednesday approved the provision for independent candidates in future elections as contained in the report of the Constitution Amendment Committee.
To that effect, Section 177 of the Constitution was altered with the insertion of a new paragraph.
The new paragraph “d” reads, “he is a member of a political party and is sponsored by that party or he is an independent candidate”. (NAN)
