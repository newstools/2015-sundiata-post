Ilorin, Feb. 7, 2015 (NAN) Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) on Saturday denied involvement in alleged attack on All Progressives Congress (APC) campaign convoy in Isapa, Kwara, home town of its governorship candidate in the state, Simeon Ajibola.
This is contained in a statement signed by the party’s Publicity Secretary in the state, Chief Rex Olawoye, and made available to newsmen in Ilorin.
According to Olawoye, both PDP and the governorship candidate did not orchestrate the attack.
He said that PDP had conducted its members and supporters in civilized manner, adding that the party did not know anything about the attack.
“The APC accusation that the PDP planned and executed the attack is not true,’’ he said. [pro_ad_display_adzone id=”10″]
He said information reaching the party indicated that it was a member of APC in the town that first attacked the house of one of our members.
“Information at our disposal is that an official of the APC-led government in the state, mobilised thugs to molest and attack the property of a PDP member in Isapa,” Olawoye stated.
He said that the APC official was known for perpetrating electoral fraud and violence in Ekiti Local Government Area and other parts of the state.
He alleged that APC had attacked PDP supporters who turned out in large number for a rally in Kaima Local Government on Wednesday.
“More worrisome is the allegation that guns have been imported into this state by the ruling party in the state,’’ he said.
Olawoye, therefore, appealed to the police and other security agencies in the state to step up efforts to checkmate activities of trouble makers. (NAN)
