He urged Christians not to cheat in their dealings but should rather be honest and faithful. Emmanuel, who decried the manner some Christians cheat in their business dealings, said unfaithfulness does not glorify God and urged Christians to be accountable in their businesses. He urged Christians to be faithful to God and their fellow men. “Faithfulness, accountability, generosity, divine guidance and gratitude are the hallmarks of breakthrough in a Christian’s business and career,’’ the pastor said.
