Lagos- Some eligible voters on Tuesday expressed concern over their inability to obtain the Permanent Voters Card (PVC) in Lagos.
They expressed the concern in separate interviews with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Lagos. Mr Tekena Wakama, a legal practitioner, told NAN that many of the eligible voters in his area were unable to obtain the PVC. Wakama said although he had been fully registered in Surulere Local Government, he was unable to get his card ahead of the forthcoming election.

It’s among the local government areas in Lagos State that was delayed. “And behold when they (PVCs) came out and we went to check, they said it didn’t come out. It means I’m going to be disenfranchised. “I won’t have the opportunity and privilege to vote for a candidate of my choice. Definitely, there is no election that is perfect in any part of the world.
“We have challenges here but I pray that INEC should be able to do what is right so that people would be able to vote candidates of their choice so as to have a credible election. ”I registered duly; I have my temporary voter card but due to the fault of INEC not mine; I am not going to be able to vote.’’ [pro_ad_display_adzone id=”10″] [pro_ad_display_adzone id=”8″] Malik Ogunde, an automobile mechanic, also complained about not being able to obtain his PVC, saying that INEC did not organise the distribution of the cards well. Ogunde said a lot of people would not be able to exercise their right to vote in so many areas because of the shortcomings of INEC. Mr Tega Agoda, a Batch ‘C’ National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) member serving in Kogi, however, commended INEC because he was able to collect his card.
“I registered in Surulere during the initial registration; that is why I came all the way from my place of service to collect my PVC.
“I am happy that I was able to collect mine even though I can see a lot of people complaining about their cards not being found.’’ (NAN)
