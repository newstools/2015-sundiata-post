Gusau- Alhaji Mamuda Shinkafi , the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) gubernatorial candidate, has promised to improve education, healthcare services and security in Zamfara State, if elected.
Shinkafi, who was the former governor of the state under the ANPP, made the promise on Saturday in Gusau at the flag-off of his campaign.
“it is unfortunate that instead of the state to be progressing in the areas of education, healthcare, and security, it is undergoing serious backwardness.”
According to him, when he left office in 2011, the State Government had over 100 medical doctors and now has less than 40 doctors. [pro_ad_display_adzone id=”10″] [pro_ad_display_adzone id=”8″]
“My administration, if re-elected in February, will give priority to education, healthcare, security, harness mineral resources, as well as improve farming activities in the state,’’ he said.
The candidate noted that women empowerment would also be part of his administration’s topmost priority.
He said that from the huge number of people that attended the flag-off, it could be deduced that the PDP would win all elections in the state.
The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the ceremony was attended by PDP stalwarts, including the former National Chairman of the party, Alhaji Bello Haliru.
Others were the two former governors of Sokoto State, Attahiru Bafarawa and Garba Nadama, as well as the Minister of Special Duties, Alhaji Kabiru Turaki and Minister of State for finance, Alhaji Bashir Yuguda. (NAN)
