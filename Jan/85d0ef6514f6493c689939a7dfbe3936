Abuja- Kano Pillars’ coach Ibrahim Musa on Friday said his team were taught a good lesson by Warri Wolves FC with their 1-3 loss at the Abuja National Stadium. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Warri Wolves, who had before then lost all their three matches, resurged by whipping the 2013/2014 Glo Premier League champions. The match was part of the ongoing 2014/2015 Glo Premier League Super 4 Invitational Tournament. Musa, however, said at the post-match conference that the whole experience of losing to the Wolves had thought the Pillars a lesson. “It is a good thing that we lost to the Wolves, because we have learnt a vital lesson today, which is to go back to the drawing board to correct our mistakes. “It is our stepping stone. In every match you play you are bound to see lapses. [pro_ad_display_adzone id=”10″] “That is why when we go back to the drawing board, we will make amends,’’ the coach said. Meanwhile, the club’s captain, Theophilus Afelokhai, said the reason for their loss to Warri Wolves was “personal to the players’’ and not meant to be shared with the public. “I know the reason for our loss and it is a personal issue between the players. But when we get back to the hotel we will resolve the issue amongst ourselves,’’ he said. Speaking also, the Warri Wolves coach, Paul Aigbogun, said the team displayed purposeful football and got a favourable result. He said the team had been playing good football all the while but had unfortunately lost their previous games. “It is unfortunate that we did not score in our previous matches, because we have been playing good football. “It’s been a build-up. So, fortunately the goals came today, even though it has been the same inputs in our other matches,’’ the coach said. NAN recalls that Kano Pillars have six points from four matches played, having won two and lost two, while Warri Wolves have three points from four matches played.(NAN)
