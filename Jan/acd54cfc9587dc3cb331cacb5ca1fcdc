Mavin boss and superstar producer Don Jazzy was among the chart-topping artists who performed on Friday at the All Progressives Cngress (APC) presidential rally.
Don Jazzy, who joined the APC delegates as they enjoyed an open air bus ride to the rally location Teslim Balogun Stadium in Surulere, was
greeted by fans that were also on the rally ground to show support to the party’s presidential nominee, Muhammadu Buhari and his vice-presidential nominee, Yemi Osinbajo.

There was some light-hearted fun as the Governor of Lagos State, Babatunde Fashola showed off some steps as he
danced off the stage to the track.
Another highlight of the campaign was seen by Olamide who entertained the APC elder statesman, Bola Tinubu as he approached the stage dancing.
Davido and Dammy Krane also entertained the huge crowd that gathered for the presidential rally.
