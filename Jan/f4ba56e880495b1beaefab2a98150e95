Umuahia- The Abia Government said it has awarded N110 million contract for the installation of solar powered traffic lights at strategic junctions in Umuahia, the State capital. The Commissioner for Information and Strategy, Chief Anthony Agbazuere, said this at a news conference on the outcome of the State Executive Council meeting in Umuahia on Thursday. He said the traffic lights would be mounted at Okpara Square, Federal Medical Centre, Isi-Gate-Umuwaya, BCA, Uzuakoli Road Junctions and the Government House roundabout. He also said the inauguration of the proposed airport in Ikwuano would soon take place, adding that the peace meeting between the government and land owners was being concluded. He said the Aba Mega Mall had been completed while about 2,000 shops were ready for subscription by interested traders. On politics, the commissioner said the State Government had uncovered plans by some opposition political parties in the state to clone the Permanent Voter Cards (PVCs) to rig the elections. [pro_ad_display_adzone id=”10″] Agbazuere said the parties involved were already moving from house to house attempting to buy the PVCs from the electorate. “Government is aware of the ploy by some opposition political parties, going from house to house to buy PVCs from people for cloning’’, he said. He, therefore, advised Abia residents not to sell their cards, resist such offers and safeguard their PVCs. The commissioner reminded eligible voters that their voter cards remained the only power they had to vote in the forthcoming polls. Agbazuere warned “perpetrators of the act’’ to desist from it or be prepared to face the full wrath of the law. (NAN)
