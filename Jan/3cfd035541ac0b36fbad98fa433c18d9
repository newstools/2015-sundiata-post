“Piracy is killing business and not helping the growth of the industry.
“Piracy has made things difficult for producers who have expended their resources on production of films.
“Therefore, producers tend to manage cost in order not to lose the market
“Government should set up result oriented committees that will be more proactive in the issue of piracy in entertainment industry.
“Film producers are not enjoying the industry anymore because of their experience concerning piracy.’’
He urged the Federal Government to strengthen the campaign against piracy.
“Government should see the industry as a huge income earner.
“Government should assist by putting necessary actions in place to ensure that copyright owners enjoyed the fruits of their labour.
“It is not good for some people to spend money to produce films and allow other people to hijack the benefits, “ he said.
Odule said that the government could achieve these by working hand in hand with stakeholders. (NAN)
