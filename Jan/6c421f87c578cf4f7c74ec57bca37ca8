The commission’s Resident Electoral Commissioner (REC) in the state, Alhaji Minkaila Abdullahi, made the call in an interview with News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Kano on Saturday.
Minkaila said that the distribution of the cards had been on in the state and advised the voters yet to collect their cards, including those who registered recently, to quickly do so before the elections.
“Since the commencement of the distribution of the PVCs, the record we have showed that there are many people that are yet to collect their cards at the various distribution centres.
‘’Recently, the commission extended the distribution of the cards from local government level to ward centres for easy collection of the card by members of the public.
‘’Also, the commission has extended the time for the collection of the cards from 8.30 a.m. to 5.30 p.m.,” he said.
He therefore called on eligible voters to go to the centres where they were registered to collect their cards, adding that cards for all newly-registered voters were ready.
According to him, the commission had already taken a decision that only those with their permanent voter cards would be allowed to vote during the elections. (NAN)
