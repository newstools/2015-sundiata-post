Alhaji Hassan Saba, Niger PDP Publicity Secretary, disclosed this in a statement on Saturday in Minna.
The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that an election petition tribunal on Friday upturned the result of the senatorial bye-election in favour of Mr David Umoru of the All Progressives Congress (APC).
The statement, however, urged its members to remain calm and committed to winning the forthcoming general elections.
It advised APC loyalists not to rejoice yet, adding that the tribunal verdict did not reflect what transpired at the polls.
NAN recalled that the Niger State Zone B Senatorial bye-election was conducted in August 2014 to replace the vacancy created as a result of the death of Sen. Dahiru Kuta. (NAN)
