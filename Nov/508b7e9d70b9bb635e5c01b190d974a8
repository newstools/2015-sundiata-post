Lagos – A clergyman, Mr Wasiu Aderibigbe, on Friday charged artistes in the entertainment industry to replicate the Federal Government’s concerted fight against corruption in the sector.
Aderibigbe told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Lagos that there was an urgent need for the artistes to educate their associates on the consequences of corrupt acts.
He added that a situation where actors who played negative roles in movies and musical videos ended up being accepted as heroes was unacceptable.
Aderibigbe said the industry wielded so much influence that some people could be misled into believing that only those with corrupt tendencies could become successful.
“The culture of corruption can better be fought if we begin to re-educate ourselves, dedicate ourselves to service and change the role models we aspire to be like.

“In our movies, for instance, the hero is the politician that ends up killing anybody who aspires for the same position, in order to be the lone competitor and this should not be the case,’’ he said.
On the piracy scourge, he said that the efforts of government in the fight against piracy in the country were commendable.
“Piracy is an obstacle that is obstructing the growth of the business.
“For the entertainment industry to grow, the issue of piracy needs to be adequately addressed, “ he said.
Aderibigbe said that the sector was a multi-billion naira industry that could boost the nation`s revenue, if properly harnessed. (NAN)
