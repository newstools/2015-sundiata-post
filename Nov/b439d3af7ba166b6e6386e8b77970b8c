Pankshin (Plateau) – The Chairman, Pankshin Local Government Area of Plateau, Mr Stephen Jings, has commended the efforts of the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) in the fight against hard drug trafficking and consumption. The chairman gave the commendation on Friday during a familiarisation visit to the office of the NDLEA Area Command in Pankshin. Jings said that the dangers of hard drugs consumption could not be over-emphasised, given the millions of lives the drugs had jeopardised in the last three decades. He added that “we in this council are happy about your role in combating hard drugs consumption and trafficking across the nation and especially here in Pankshin.[pro_ad_display_adzone id=”70560″] “In fact, we can testify that there is drastic reduction in the consumption of hard drugs among our citizens and we are ready to synergise with NDLEA to eradicate it completely. “Synergy is very essential because when our children are drug-free, the society will be crime-free and we will all be safe.’’ Responding, the Chief Superintendent of Narcotics of the Agency, Mr Felix Odigwe, said NDLEA embarked on public enlightenment in order to educate youths on the dangers of hard drugs consumption. He said “we are moving from community to community in order to educate people on the dangers and effects of hard drugs on young people. “We start even with those at kindergarten so that when they grow up, they would not like to have anything to do with drugs.’’ (NAN)
