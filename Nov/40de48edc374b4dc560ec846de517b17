New Bussa (Niger)  – The wife of the President, Mrs Aisha Buhari, said the late Emir of Borgu, Alhaji Haliru Dantoro, in Niger, was one of the architects of the current new Nigeria being run by the APC. She stated this during a condolence visit to the family of the late emir on Friday in New Bussa, Niger. She said it was sad that the emir died shortly after the new government had been formed. “It is sad that we now have a new Nigeria in place, which he was part of it but without him today,’’ she said. The president’s wife said the emir died when he was most needed in the country. She described the deceased as a great man who believed in the unity and peace of the great nation. She prayed Allah to grant the family, the people of Borgu Emirate, the state and the country at large the fortitude to bear the loss. Also, the wife of the Governor of Niger, Dr Amina Abubakar, described the deceased as a nationalist, who had the love of the state and country at heart. She said he would be remembered for his contribution to the development of Borgu kingdom, the state and the country in general.
