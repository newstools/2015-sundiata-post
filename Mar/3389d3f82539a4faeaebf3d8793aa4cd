ABEOKUTA—The re-election campaign of Governor Ibikunle Amosun of Ogun State turned bloody during his visit to Remo North Local Council of the state, when the supporters of the All Progressives Congress, APC, and the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, clashed leaving some people injured.
[pro_ad_display_adzone id=”10″] An eye witness said that the violence occurred when the APC senatorial candidate for Ogun East, Prince Dapo Abiodun and APC’s House of Assembly candidate, Ikenne state constituency, Olusola Sonuga, embarked on a walk across Iperu with their supporters. It was gathered that during the walk on the old Lagos-Ibadan Road of the town, members of the parties clashed and dangerous weapons were used in the free for all. During the mayhem, people scampered for safety while some innocent members of the public were reportedly injured. Chairman, PDP, Ikenne Local Government, Gboyega Ogunfowokan, accused members of the APC of masterminding the violence. He said: “The PDP remains law-abiding and will always be of good conduct, despite several provocations and record of various attacks among which was the January 17, 2015 incident, when our secretariat at Ikenne was vandalised and various items including the party flags were destroyed. Reacting to the allegation,  Chairman Media and Publicity of Amosun campaign Organisation, Femi Sowoolu, absolved the APC of any blame. He said the governor was too busy with his work for him to have time for violence, adding that the APC was on ground and did not need to unleash violence on the people of the state. (Vanguard)
