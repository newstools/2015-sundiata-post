By Lexi Elo Just as a fortnight ago when Dolphins of Port Harcourt Football Club hosted Equatoguinean side Leones Vegetarianos in the CAF Confederation Cup preliminary round second leg tie, Dolphins will play their first round, first leg match against Tunisia’s Club Africain in Tunis on Saturday, a source from the club revealed to Goal.com. Media officer, China Acheru disclosed that the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF)  has confirmed that the first leg of the encounter will come up on Saturday by 3pm local time at the Stade Olympique de Rades.[pro_ad_display_adzone id=”10″] He added that the Tunisian side notified the NFF of the development and that the football house immediately briefed the Port Harcourt side, so that the club can communicate its itinerary to their hosts before match day. “We have been told that the match will be played on Saturday and that it will start by 3pm their local time there. We were also told that the game will be played at the Stade Olympique. We are delighted with this information from the NFF and we shall do all within our powers to ensure that we give a very good account of ourselves in Tunis this weekend,” Acheru told Goal.com
Dolphins will go for the first leg tie with the notion that they must do better than they did against the Equatoguineans and also in their last weekend league tie against Kwara United where they were held to a goalless draw. The encounter on Saturday will mark the first time Dolphins will be facing a club from Tunisia in any Caf-organized club competition.
