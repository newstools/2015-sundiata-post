DAR ES SALAAM – At least 41 people were killed and dozens injured when a bus and a truck collided on a busy road in south-west Tanzania on Wednesday, police said, warning that the death toll could rise. Officers said many died when a container that was being ferried on the truck fell on the bus after impact, crushing the victims on a highway in Iringa, about 460 km (276 miles) south-west of the commercial capital Dar es Salaam.
