We pray that God will heal the injured players and officials. We also condemn the attack in strong term. We call on the police to beef up security on highways so that motorists will not continue to develop fears plying the Nigerian roads,” the statement available with Goal revealed. Pillars players and officials were attacked by armed robbers on the Abaji-Lokoja road last Thursday on their way to Owerri for the star match of the 2014/2015 premier league season. Five of their players were gunned by the armed bandits with three of them sustaining injuries that may keep them on the sidelines for some time.
