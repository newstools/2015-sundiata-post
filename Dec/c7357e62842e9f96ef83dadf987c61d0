Abuja  – The Nigeria Police on Wednesday unveiled a Nigerian musician, Korede Bello as the Police Youth Ambassador.
Unveiling the youth ambassador and anti-crime jingles, the Inspector-General of Police, Mr Solomon Arase said that youths were critical to the fight against crime in the country.
Represented by Deputy Inspector-General of Police, Danazumi Doma, Director, Finance and Administration, Arase said:
“Korede Bello, you are the positive representation of Nigerian youths and on this occasion, the Nigeria Police celebrates you.
“We believe Korede Bello’s exemplary behaviour and tenacity of purpose, like that of the Nigeria Police, will be the needed influence to change the wrong or misconceived habits of some of our youths.
“It is, therefore, my firm conviction that in fighting crimes in our system, the youths are critical elements that must be incorporated.
“The process of bringing the youths into our fold as crime-fighting channels is very critical to the policing of this country.’’
He said Nigerian youths deserved to play a more important and significant role in improving the country’s security framework.
Arase said the idea was aimed at spreading security awareness and sensitisation to schools and universities in crime prevention.
Police spokesperson, ACP Olabsisi Kolawole said the opportunity would build awareness and foster development of the youths. [pro_ad_display_adzone id=”70560″]
