Jos – A Jos Chief Magistrates’ Court on Thursday sentenced a 25-year-old man, Abubakar Mohammed, to one month imprisonment for impersonating as a member of the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC). The Magistrate, Mr Tijanni Zololo handed down the sentence after Mohammed pleaded guilty to the crime and begged the court for leniency. Zololo, however, gave the convict an option of N100, 000 fine. He said that the sentence was meant to serve as a deterrent to those who might want to engage in similar acts.
The convict in his plea, attributed his action to the work of the devil, “I don’t know what came over me; it was the devil that made me do it.
