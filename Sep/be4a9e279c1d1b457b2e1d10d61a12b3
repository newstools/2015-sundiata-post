Nsukka (Enugu State) – Mr Kenneth Onyishi, a community leader in Nsukka, Enugu State, has urged Nigerians to support President Muhammadu Buhari’s fight against corruption.
Onyishi who spoke in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Tuesday in Nsukka, said the President cannot succeed without the support of Nigerians.
“ We should not see this fight as a responsibility of Mr President alone but a Nigerian project in order to move this country to the next level.
“Ordinarily, the level of poverty and unemployment could not have reached this rate if not for mismanagement of resources by successive governments, “he said.
