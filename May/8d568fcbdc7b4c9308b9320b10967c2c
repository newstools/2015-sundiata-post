ABUJA  – President of the Nigeria Basketball Federation (NBBF), Tijani Umar, on Monday in Abuja said the national basketball teams would resume camp on Sunday in Abuja. Umar said the men’s and women’s national teams would camp in Nigeria ahead of preparations for the 11th All-Africa Games (AAG) and the 2015 Afrobasket for Men and Women. “We need to bring a level-playing field for both the overseas-based and home-based players to compete for places on the teams ahead of the tournaments,” he said. Umar said a two-man Task Force would soon travel to the U.S. in respect of this. He said the task force comprised himself and the Federation’s Vice President, who doubles as the Chairman of the Technical Committee, Mukhtar Khaleh. “This is to interface with the U.S.-based players and organise friendlies and prospective training tours ahead of the competitions. “We already have friendly matches and pre-tournament competitions lined up in Europe and in China, but we will also have a training tour in the U.S., even though we will camp in Abuja, “The task force will leave for the U.S. immediately after the qualification tournament for the 2015 Afrobasket Women in Abidjan, Cote D’Ivoire on May 30.
